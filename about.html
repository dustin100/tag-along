        <h2>Additional Caregivers:</h2>
        <p>
          If additional caregivers are required, we ensure they pass a thorough
          screening process, and are CPR-First Aid trained along with having a
          Police Clearance check. Tag Along chooses caregivers and educators
          with diverse, creative backgrounds who share our philosophy of
          empowering children through play.
